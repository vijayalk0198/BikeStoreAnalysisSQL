# SQL for Business Intelligence: Analysing Bike Store Data Across Key Operational Areas

SQL is a powerful and versatile tool that can handle a wide range of analytical tasks, from simple calculations like totals and averages to complex data analysis involving multiple criteria. To explore this, a comprehensive SQL project was conducted using a sample bike store database. 

This database consists of 9 interconnected tables, ranging from Brands and Products to Customers, and Orders, providing a comprehensive framework for analysing various business operations. It is designed to analyse data for 3 stores, handling over 5,000 orders from 1,500 customers, providing a robust foundation for comprehensive business analysis.  The analysis is segmented into 5 key categories: Customer Behaviour, Revenue Tracking, Stock Management, Order Fulfilment Analysis, and Brand Performance. This structure supports diverse and insightful queries to drive data-driven decision-making across various business functions.

#### Methodology:
• Created a database in MySQL, designed tables based on business requirements, imported data using MySQL's Data Import Wizard, and generated an ER diagram to visually showcase the relationships within the database.
<br>
• Performed data pre-processing by cleaning the data, handling NULL values, and ensuring data consistency across key columns.
<br>
• Implemented data validation checks and transformations, including calculating sale prices, categorizing order statuses, and tracking on-time deliveries.
<br>
• Framed 50+ analytical questions covering all planned categories of analysis, using SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, grouping, subqueries, CTEs and window functions to extract insights.

#### Some key questions explored include:
• Total revenue from repeat customers vs. new customers
<br>
• Highest revenue per customer by state
<br>
• Average time between a customer’s first and last order
<br>
• Revenue generated by product and category combinations
<br>
• Customer retention rate and order frequency

#### Description of the sql files
