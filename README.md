# SQL for Business Intelligence: Analysing Bike Store Data Across Key Operational Areas

SQL is a powerful and versatile tool that can handle a wide range of analytical tasks, from simple calculations like totals and averages to complex data analysis involving multiple criteria. To explore this, a comprehensive SQL project was conducted using a sample bike store database. 

This database consists of 9 interconnected tables, ranging from Brands and Products to Customers, and Orders, providing a comprehensive framework for analysing various business operations. It is designed to analyse data for 3 stores, handling over 5,000 orders from 1,500 customers, providing a robust foundation for comprehensive business analysis.  The analysis is segmented into 5 key categories: Customer Behaviour, Revenue Tracking, Stock Management, Order Fulfilment Analysis, and Brand Performance. This structure supports diverse and insightful queries to drive data-driven decision-making across various business functions.

#### Methodology:
• Created a database in MySQL, designed tables based on business requirements, imported data using MySQL's Data Import Wizard, and generated an ER diagram to visually showcase the relationships within the database.
<br>
• Performed data pre-processing by cleaning the data, handling NULL values, and ensuring data consistency across key columns.
<br>
• Implemented data validation checks and transformations, including calculating sale prices, categorizing order statuses, and tracking on-time deliveries.
<br>
• Framed 50+ analytical questions covering all planned categories of analysis, using SQL concepts such as joins, aggregations, grouping, subqueries, CTEs and window functions to extract insights.

#### Some key questions explored include:
• Total revenue from repeat customers vs. new customers
<br>
• Highest revenue per customer by state
<br>
• Average time between a customer’s first and last order
<br>
• Revenue generated by product and category combinations
<br>
• Customer retention rate and order frequency

#### Description of the sql files
bikestore_db_creation.sql - This SQL query file establishes a relational database for bike store analysis, defining tables for key entities such as brands, categories, customers, stores, staff, orders, products, order_items, and stocks. These tables are interrelated through foreign keys, enabling comprehensive analysis of sales, inventory, and customer data. Key skills demonstrated include the use of foreign keys for data integrity, cascading actions (ON DELETE CASCADE, ON UPDATE CASCADE) to maintain consistency across tables, and primary key constraints to ensure unique records. The design supports advanced analysis, such as sales tracking, product performance, inventory management, and customer segmentation. With default values for discounts and organized table structures, this database is optimized for generating complex insights through joins and aggregations, which are vital for data-driven decision-making in a retail environment.

Key queries include calculating the total number of customers, identifying the distribution of customers by state, and determining the top 10 customers based on total amount spent, showcasing JOIN operations across multiple tables. It also calculates the average number of orders per customer and identifies customers with the highest number of orders or the largest quantity of products in a single order. Additionally, the script calculates the percentage of customers from states with active stores, providing valuable insights into regional engagement. Finally, it identifies repeat customers, using HAVING clauses to filter data based on customer purchasing frequency. These queries highlight essential data aggregation, filtering, and performance analysis skills, key for a data analyst assessing customer behaviour and business performance.

sales_analysis.sql - This SQL script provides detailed revenue and discount analysis for a bike store. It calculates total revenue generated by the store, as well as revenue breakdowns by store, brand, and product, using JOIN operations across tables such as stores, brands, and products. The script also analyses revenue trends by calculating revenue per year and month, helping to identify sales patterns over time. Additionally, it calculates the average revenue per order and identifies the top 5 products based on revenue contribution.
